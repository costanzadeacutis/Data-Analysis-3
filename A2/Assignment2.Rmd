# Setup
For the purpose of the analysis, I retain only those that can be defined as apartments in terms of property type.

I create factors from room_type variable, and I categorize it as factor variable together with f_municipio.
I remove apartments that are categorized as outside, i.e. not in one of the 9 municipi, hence not directly comparable with the others (I assume that the apartments whose prices I am trying to predict are all in the city).
I also retain only those apartments that can accommodate 2-6 guests, as the new apartments in question.

NB: Municipio - Given that the neighboorhoods are too many and too small, I regrouped them in "municipi": this categorization comes from comune.milano.it. I then factorize them.
Note: municipio_2_9 is area between Municipio 2 and Municipio 9, that could not be categorized in any of the two.

```{r data}
data <- read.csv("airbnb_milano_cleaned.csv")

#check property types
table(data$property_type)
#keep only apartments
#excluded private room cause not clear
data <- data %>% filter(property_type %in% c("Entire condo", "Entire home", "Entire home/apt", "Entire loft", "Entire place", "Entire rental unit", "Entire serviced apartment", "Entire vacation home", "Private room in condo", "Private room in home", "Private room in loft", "Private room in rental unit", "Private room in serviced apartment", "Private room in tiny home", "Private room in vacation home", "Room in serviced apartment", "Shared room in condo", "Shared room in home", "Shared room in loft", "Shared room in rental unit", "Tiny home"))

#check room types
table(data$room_type)
#remove hotel room
data <- data %>% filter(room_type %in% c("Entire home/apt", "Private room", "Shared room"))
#factor
data <- data %>% mutate(f_room_type = factor(room_type))

#categorical variables
categoricals <- c("f_room_type", "f_municipio")

for (i in 1:length(categoricals)) {
  data %>%
    group_by(get(categoricals[i])) %>%
    summarise(mean_price = mean(price) ,  n=n()) %>%
    print
}

#drop "outside" (not in the city center)
data <- data %>% filter(!(f_municipio %in% c("Outside")))

#number accommodates
data <- data %>% filter(n_accommodates %in% c(2,3,4,5,6))

#drop unused first column
drops <- c("X")
data <- data[ , !(names(data) %in% drops)]
```

## First look at the data
I have a dataset with 16833 observations and 77 variables. Some of these variables have some/many missing values: review_scores_rate, p_host_acceptance_rate, p_host_response_rate, n_days_since, n_bathrooms, f_bathrooms_type, n_beds, n_bedrooms, n_reviews_per_month

```{r first look}
glimpse(data)
skim(data)

# where do we have missing variables now?
to_filter <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
to_filter[to_filter > 0]
```

## Further cleaning - Deal with NAs
There are different ways of dealing with missing values:
1. remove when it is the target variable
2. remove those variables that have too many NAs and the variable is not that important for the analysis
3. input values (for beds, assume that the number is the same as the number of accommodates)
4. replace with median and flag when there are many but the variable is important for the analysis
```{r cleaning}
# 1. drop NA if target variable
data <- data %>%
  drop_na(price)

# 2. remove when too many
to_drop <- c("f_bathrooms_type", "p_host_response_rate", "p_host_acceptance_rate", "property_type")
data <- data %>%
  select(-one_of(to_drop))

# 3. imput when few, not that important
#bathrooms
#beds
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    n_bathrooms =  ifelse(is.na(n_bathrooms), median(n_bathrooms, na.rm = T), n_bathrooms),
    n_beds = ifelse(is.na(n_beds), n_accommodates, n_beds)) #assume n_beds=n_accommodates

to_filter <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
to_filter[to_filter > 0]


# 4. Replace missing variables + add flags
#reviews
#bedrooms
#days since
data <- data %>%
  mutate(flag_bedrooms=ifelse(is.na(n_bedrooms),1, 0),
    n_bedrooms =  ifelse(is.na(n_bedrooms), median(n_bedrooms, na.rm = T), n_bedrooms),
    flag_days_since=ifelse(is.na(n_days_since),1, 0),
    n_days_since =  ifelse(is.na(n_days_since), median(n_days_since, na.rm = T), n_days_since),
    flag_review_scores_rating=ifelse(is.na(review_scores_rating),1, 0),
    review_scores_rating =  ifelse(is.na(review_scores_rating), median(review_scores_rating, na.rm = T), review_scores_rating),
    flag_reviews_per_month=ifelse(is.na(n_reviews_per_month),1, 0),
    n_reviews_per_month =  ifelse(is.na(n_reviews_per_month), median(n_reviews_per_month, na.rm = T), n_reviews_per_month)
          )
table(data$flag_days_since)
```

## Create variables polynomials
- measuring the time since: squared, cubic, logs
- squared accommodates
- log ratings
```{r create variables}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    ln_days_since = log(n_days_since+1),
    ln_days_since2 = log(n_days_since+1)^2,
    ln_days_since3 = log(n_days_since+1)^3 ,
    n_days_since2=n_days_since^2,
    n_days_since3=n_days_since^3,
    n_accommodates2 = n_accommodates^2,
    ln_review_scores_rating = log(review_scores_rating),
    ln_days_since=ifelse(is.na(ln_days_since),0, ln_days_since),
    ln_days_since2=ifelse(is.na(ln_days_since2),0, ln_days_since2),
    ln_days_since3=ifelse(is.na(ln_days_since3),0, ln_days_since3),
  )
```


# Descriptive analysis
## Prices
The prices for these apartments range from 9 to 90180 dollars per night. Probably both the very low and the very high prices are either anomalies or were wrongly imputed, especially the very high ones. Very extreme prices would be difficult to predict.
Given these considerations, I retain only those prices above 20 and below 1500 dollars per night. The resulting dataset has 16700 observations and 90 variables, after some further data cleaning and feature engineering.
I first look at how the average price moves in terms of Municipio and room type. As expected, highest prices are in Municipio 1 (which is the core of the city) and for entire apartments/home.
I analyze the histograms for prices in levels and logs: the distribution of prices in levels is right-skewed, meaning that there are very few high prices; the log transformation gives a normally shaped distribution. Moreover, for better visualization, I only prices below 400 dollars per night, and this time I look at percentages. The same evaluation as before applies.
Finally I look at apartment price distribution by room type: it is clear that the entire apartments are priced the highest, the shared rooms the lowest, as expected.

```{r prices, warning=FALSE}

#drop very weird prices above 1500 and below 20
data <- data %>% filter(price <= 1500,

data <- data %>%
  mutate(ln_price = log(price))

  labs(x = "Room type",y = "Price (US dollars)")+
  theme_bg()
Airbnb_room_type
save_fig("Airbnb_room_type", output, "small")

```

## Number of accommodates
It can be seen from both the graph and the table that the mean price increases as the number of accommodates increase, as expected.

```{r accommodates}
## n_accommodates: look at distribution

data %>%
  group_by(n_accommodates) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price), min_price= min(price), max_price = max(price), n = n())

Airbnb_n_accommodates <- ggplot(data = data, aes(x=n_accommodates, y=price)) +
  geom_point(size=1, colour=color[3], shape=16)+
  ylim(0,1500)+
  xlim(2,6)+
  labs(x="Number of people accomodated",y="Price")+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", colour=color[1], se=FALSE)+
  theme_bg()
Airbnb_n_accommodates
```

## Number of beds and bathrooms
The number of beds ranges from 1 to 10 for these apartments. Mean prices tend to increase as the number of beds increases, with some exceptions: 8 and 9 beds have lower or equal mean prices compared to 1 or 2 beds. This is could be due to overcrowding: more beds but the meters squared do not increase.

For bathrooms, where the value is 0, it probably means that the bathroom is outside the private or shared room, thus I impute that there is at least 1. Also those 0.5, I assume that they are like 1 bathroom.
The mean price increases as the number of bathrooms increases.

```{r beds and bathrooms}
## Beds
data %>%
  group_by(n_beds) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price), min_price= min(price), max_price = max(price), n = n())

# maybe best is to have log beds
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ln_beds = log(n_beds))

ggplot(data, aes(n_beds)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = color[1], color = color.outline, alpha = 0.8, size = 0.25) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("N of beds") +
  theme_bg()

## bathrooms
data %>%
  group_by(n_bathrooms) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price), n = n())

data <- data %>%
  mutate(n_bathrooms =  ifelse(n_bathrooms==0.0, 1, n_bathrooms),
         n_bathrooms =  ifelse(n_bathrooms==0.5, 1, n_bathrooms))

ggplot(data, aes(n_bathrooms)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = color[1], color = color.outline, alpha = 0.8, size = 0.25) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("N of bathrooms") +
  theme_bg()

data %>%
  group_by(n_bathrooms) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price), n = n())


```

## Number of reviews
For better visualization, I consider only those apartments that have less then 100 reviews (those with more are not frequent). The distribution is highly right-skewed.
I also create a factor variable for 3 categories: apartments with either none, 1-50, or 51+ reviews. Apartments with 0 reviews appear to have higher mean prices.

```{r number of reviews}
## Number of reviews

ggplot(data, aes(n_number_of_reviews)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = 'navyblue', color = 'white', alpha = 0.8, size = 0.25) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("N of reviews") +
  theme_bw()

nreview_plot <- data %>%
  filter(n_number_of_reviews <100)

ggplot(nreview_plot, aes(n_number_of_reviews)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = color[1], color = color.outline, alpha = 0.8, size = 0.25) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("N of reviews") +
  theme_bg()

# number of reviews: use logs as well
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ln_number_of_reviews = log(n_number_of_reviews+1))

ggplot(data, aes(ln_number_of_reviews)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = color[1], color = color.outline, alpha = 0.8, size = 0.25) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("Log N of reviews") +
  theme_bg()

# Pool num of reviews to 3 categories: none, 1-51 and >51
data <- data %>%
  mutate(f_number_of_reviews = cut(n_number_of_reviews, c(0,1,51,max(data$n_number_of_reviews)+1), labels=c(0,1,2), right = F))

data %>%
  group_by(f_number_of_reviews) %>%
  summarise(median_price = median(price), mean_price = mean(price) ,  n=n())


```

## Review scores rating
From the graph, most of the apartments have a high review score, but there is no clear relation with daily prices.

```{r review scores}
## review score effect
data %>%
  group_by(review_scores_rating) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price), min_price= min(price), max_price = max(price), n = n())

ggplot(data = data, aes(x=review_scores_rating , y=price)) +
  geom_point(size=1.5, colour=color[3], shape=4) +
  ylim(0,1500)+
  xlim(0,5)+
  geom_smooth(method="loess", colour=color[1], se=F)+
  labs(x="Review score",y="Daily price (USD)")+
  theme_bg()

```

## Minimum nights
It is not specified if the apartments in this project are intended for short or long stays; however, usually Airbnbs are mostly for short stays. Therefore, I created a factor for 4 categories: 1, 2, 3-7, 8+ minimum nights. 

```{r minimum nights}
# minimum nights
#not specified if only short stays

data %>%
  group_by(n_minimum_nights) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price), min_price= min(price), max_price = max(price), n = n())

data <- data %>%
  mutate(f_minimum_nights= cut(n_minimum_nights, c(1,2,3,7,max(data$n_minimum_nights)+1), labels=c(1,2,3,4), right = F))

data %>%
  group_by(f_minimum_nights) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price), min_price= min(price), max_price = max(price), n = n())

```





# Models
My analysis starts by looking at potential interactions: 
1. Minimum nights with children friendly amenities, presence of a gym, kitchen amenities, outdoor furniture
2. Room type with elevator, kitchen amenities, wardrobe, special view
3. Bathrooms with bathtub, hot tub, bathroom essentials, essentials
From the bar charts, it can be seen that do not emerge very clear interactions

```{r interactions, warning=FALSE}

#Look up min nights interactions
p1 <- price_diff_by_variables2(data, "f_minimum_nights", "d_babykit", "Minimum nights", "Children friendly")
p2 <- price_diff_by_variables2(data, "f_minimum_nights", "d_gym", "Minimum nights", "Gym")

p3 <- price_diff_by_variables2(data, "f_minimum_nights", "d_kitchenamenities", "Minimum nights", "Kitchen amenities")
p4 <- price_diff_by_variables2(data, "f_minimum_nights", "d_outdoorfurniture", "Minimum nights", "Outdoor furniture")

p11 <- price_diff_by_variables2(data, "n_bathrooms", "d_bathroomessentials", "Bathrooms", "Bathroom essentials")
p12 <- price_diff_by_variables2(data, "n_bathrooms", "d_essentials", "Bathrooms", "Essentials")


g_interactions3 <- plot_grid(p9, p10, p11, p12, nrow=2, ncol=2)
g_interactions3
save_fig("interactions_bathroom",output,"large")


```

## General setup
I group variables in basic variables, additional variables, review variables, and variables or higher order. These are the variables that I use in the analysis. Moreover, I put a d_ in front of all amenities dummies.
Then, I randomly create:
- Work set (data_work, 80% of the total data): where I will do the model building, the selection of the best model and the prediction;
- Holdout set (data_holdout, 20% of the total data): part of the data for evaluating the prediction itself
Finally, I create interactions following the graphs and interactions of variables that I believe are more relevant with the amenities. 

```{r setup models}

# Basic Variables
basic_lev  <- c("n_accommodates", "f_room_type", "f_municipio")
# Additional variables
basic_add <- c("n_beds", "n_bathrooms", "f_minimum_nights", "n_days_since", "flag_days_since")
reviews <- c("f_number_of_reviews","review_scores_rating", "flag_review_scores_rating")
# Higher orders
poly_lev <- c("n_accommodates2", "n_days_since2", "n_days_since3")

# Dummy variables: Extras -> collect all options and create dummies
amenities <-  grep("^d_.*", names(data), value = TRUE)


# Separate the Holdout set, and obtain the Working data

# create a holdout set (20% of observations)
smp_size <- floor(0.2 * nrow(data))

# Set the random number generator: It will make results reproducible
set.seed(20180123)

# create ids:
# 1) seq_len: generate regular sequences
# 2) sample: select random rows from a table
holdout_ids <- sample(seq_len(nrow(data)), size = smp_size)
data$holdout <- 0
data$holdout[holdout_ids] <- 1

#Hold-out set Set
data_holdout <- data %>% filter(holdout == 1)

#Working data set
data_work <- data %>% filter(holdout == 0)

#Interactions suggested by the graphs
X1 <- c("f_minimum_nights*(d_babykit+d_outdoorfurniture+d_gym)")
#Additional interactions
X2  <- c(paste0("(f_room_type+f_municipio+f_minimum_nights+n_bathrooms) * (",
                paste(amenities, collapse=" + "),")"))

```

## OLS regressions with cross validation
In the following section, I construct 6 different models where prices are regressed on
- M1: number of accomodates
- M2: M1 + basic var + additional var + review var
- M3: M2 + polynomials
- M4: M3 + suggested interactions
- M5: M4 + amenities
- M6: M5 + additional interactions
Before running these regressions, I expect at least the 6th model to be too complex, i.e. too many coefficients.
I then set up a 5-fold cross-validation for model selection: the models are estimated on the training sample (data_train), and then the predictive performance is evaluated on the rest of the data, i.e. on the test sample (data_test). The aim is to avoid overfitting, i.e. better fit to original data, but worse with live data.
From the summary table, it can be seen that as the complexity increases, the RMSE, which measures how well the model predicts, decreases in the training set, while it first decreases and then increases in the test set. This is clearly shown by the graph. To chose the best model among those evaluated, I look at the lowest RMSE in the test set, which corresponds to model 5. While, more complex models as M6 are overfitting.
By choosing model 5, it seems that the relevant variables for the predictions are the those in basic, additional, reviews, amenities, and suggested interactions groups.

## Regression with LASSO
I now look into LASSO, which is an automatic method to select variables: it shrinks coefficients towards zero of those variables that variables whose inclusion does not improve the fit of the regression. This is equivalent to removing them from the regression.
I use M6 with 819 candidate features and I ran the LASSO algorithm with 5-fold cross-validation for selecting the optimal for the tuning parameter lambda (which gives the weight to the penalty term). The optimal lambda is 0.5 and the suggested features to be kept are 361: LASSO removed many features that were included in M6, but the number is greater than that in M5, which was chosen through cross-validation in the previous part. LASSO does slightly better in terms of prediction compared to M5 (101.7 against 102.5). It works only slightly better, which means that I can keep M5 as my preferred model: in fact, even if LASSO is fast and automatic, it is hard to interpret.

```{r LASSO, warning=FALSE}
#LASSO
# take models 5 (the best) and model 6 (overfit)
vars_model_5 <- c("price", basic_lev,basic_add,reviews,poly_lev,X1,amenities)
vars_model_6 <- c("price", basic_lev,basic_add,reviews,poly_lev,X1,amenities,X2)

# Set lasso tuning parameters
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = n_folds)
tune_grid <- expand.grid("alpha" = c(1), "lambda" = seq(0.05, 1, by = 0.05))

# Use model 6 
formula <- formula(paste0("price ~ ", paste(setdiff(vars_model_6, "price"), collapse = " + ")))

set.seed(20180124)
lasso_model <- caret::train(formula,
                      data = data_work,
                      method = "glmnet",
                      preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
                      trControl = train_control,
                      tuneGrid = tune_grid,
                    na.action=na.exclude)

print(lasso_model$bestTune$lambda)

lasso_coeffs <- coef(lasso_model$finalModel, lasso_model$bestTune$lambda) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "variable") %>%
  rename(coefficient = `s1`)  # the column has a name "s1", to be renamed

print(lasso_coeffs)

lasso_coeffs_nz<-lasso_coeffs %>%
  filter(coefficient!=0)
print(nrow(lasso_coeffs_nz))

# Evaluate model. CV error:
lasso_cv_rmse <- lasso_model$results %>%
  filter(lambda == lasso_model$bestTune$lambda) %>%
  dplyr::select(RMSE)
print(lasso_cv_rmse[1, 1])


```


### Diagnostics
After choosing M5 as the best model, I want to evaluate the actual prediction with post-prediction diagnostics. First, I calculate the RMSE of this model in the Holdout set. The RMSE is lower than in the cross validation. I also look at the resulting RMSE in the Holdout set when using LASSO. It is again lower than the cross validation, quite close to that from M5. Therefore, I perform the diagnostic analysis on M5.
From the first graph, it can be noticed that most of the low prices are quite well predicted, but the high prices are wrongly predicted. In the bar chart of price variation by size, it emerges that the model generates very wide 80% PI intervals. Therefore, predictions are quite imprecise.

```{r diagnostics, warning=FALSE}
#Diagnostics on M5
#model2_level <- model_results_cv[["modellev2"]][["model_work_data"]]
model5_level <- model_results_cv[["modellev5"]][["model_work_data"]]
# look at holdout RMSE
model5_level_work_rmse <- mse_lev(predict(model5_level, newdata = data_work), data_work[,"price"])**(1/2)
model5_level_holdout_rmse <- mse_lev(predict(model5_level, newdata = data_holdout), data_holdout[,"price"])**(1/2)
model5_level_holdout_rmse

#look at holdout RMSE using LASSO
model_lasso_holdout_rmse <- mse_lev(predict(lasso_model, newdata = data_holdout), data_holdout[,"price"])**(1/2)
model_lasso_holdout_rmse
#LASSO gives a slightly lower RMSE

# Figures for fitted vs actual outcome variables

## Random forest
### Set up
I keep the same working data and holdout set, same combinations of variables and I predict 3 models with RF:
- RF1. basic vars
- RF2. RF1 + reviews + amenities
- RFE. equal to M6 (for LASSO)
```{r RF setup}

#use same train(work) and holdout

dim(data_work)
dim(data_holdout)

#basic_lev
#basic_add
basic_vars <- c(basic_lev,basic_add)
#reviews
#amenities
#X1,X2

predictors_1 <- c(basic_vars) #RF1
predictors_2 <- c(basic_vars, reviews, amenities) #RF2
predictors_E <- c(basic_vars, reviews, X1, amenities, X2) #RFE

```
